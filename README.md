# Integrative Computational Strategies for Drug Discovery: QSAR and Deep Learning Models against Trypanosoma cruzi Cruzipain
# Abstract
Cruzipain inhibitors are required after medications to treat Chagas disease because of the need for safer, more effective treatments. Trypanosoma cruzi is the source of cruzipain, a crucial cysteine protease that has drove interest in using computational
methods to create more effective inhibitors. We employed a 3D QSAR model, using a dataset of 36 known inhibitors, and a pharmacophore model to identify potential
inhibitors for cruzipain. We also built a deep learning model using the Deep purpose library, trained on 204 active compounds, and validated it with a specific test
set. During a comprehensive screening of the Drug Bank database of 8,533 molecules, pharmacophore and deep learning models identified 1,012 and 340 drug-like molecules,respectively. 
These molecules were further evaluated through molecular docking, followed by Induced Fit Docking. Ultimately, molecular dynamics simulation was done
for final potent inhibitors that exhibited strong binding interactions. These results present four novel cruzipain inhibitors that can inhibit the cruzipain protein of T.cruzi.
